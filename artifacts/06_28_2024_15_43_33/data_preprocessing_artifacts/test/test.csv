C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0149.wav,PRS must develop the capacity to classify its subjects on a more sophisticated basis than the present geographic breakdown.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0150.wav,Its present manual filing system is obsolete;
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0151.wav,it makes no use of the recent developments in automatic data processing which are widely used in the business world and in other Government offices.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0152.wav,The Secret Service and the Department of the Treasury now recognize this critical need.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0153.wav,"In the planning document currently under review by the Bureau of the Budget, the Department recommends that it be permitted to hire five qualified persons, quote,"
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0154.wav,"to plan and develop a workable and efficient automated file and retrieval system, end quote."
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0155.wav,Also the Department requests the sum of one hundred thousand dollars to conduct a detailed feasibility study;
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0156.wav,"this money would be used to compensate consultants, to lease standard equipment or to purchase specially designed pilot equipment."
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0157.wav,"On the basis of such a feasibility study,"
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0158.wav,the Department hopes to design a practical system which will fully meet the needs of the Protective Research Section of the Secret Service.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0159.wav,The Commission recommends that prompt and favorable consideration be given to this request.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0160.wav,The Commission further recommends that the Secret Service coordinate its planning as closely as possible with all of the Federal agencies from which it receives information.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0161.wav,The Secret Service should not and does not plan to develop its own intelligence gathering facilities to duplicate the existing facilities of other Federal agencies.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0162.wav,"In planning its data processing techniques,"
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0163.wav,the Secret Service should attempt to develop a system compatible with those of the agencies from which most of its data will come. Note:
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0164.wav,"In evaluating data processing techniques of the Secret Service,"
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0165.wav,"the Commission had occasion to become informed, to a limited extent, about the data processing techniques of other Federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies."
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0166.wav,"The Commission was struck by the apparent lack of effort, on an interagency basis,"
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0167.wav,"to develop coordinated and mutually compatible systems, even where such coordination would not seem inconsistent"
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0168.wav,with the particular purposes of the agency involved. The Commission recognizes that this is a controversial area
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0169.wav,and that many strongly held views are advanced in resistance to any suggestion that an effort be made to impose any degree of coordination.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0170.wav,"This matter is obviously beyond the jurisdiction of the Commission,"
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0171.wav,but it seems to warrant further study before each agency becomes irrevocably committed to separate action.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0172.wav,"The Commission, therefore, recommends that the President consider ordering an inquiry into the possibility"
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0173.wav,"that coordination might be achieved to a greater extent than seems now to be contemplated, without interference with the primary mission of each agency involved."
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0174.wav,Protective Research participation in advance arrangements.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0175.wav,"Since the assassination, Secret Service procedures have been changed to require that a member of PRS accompany each advance survey team"
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0176.wav,to establish liaison with local intelligence gathering agencies and to provide for the immediate evaluation of information received from them.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0177.wav,This PRS agent will also be responsible for establishing an informal local liaison committee
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0178.wav,to make certain that all protective intelligence activities are coordinated.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0179.wav,"Based on its experience during this period, the Secret Service now recommends that additional personnel be made available to PRS"
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0180.wav,so that these arrangements can be made permanent without adversely affecting the operations of the Service's field offices.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0181.wav,The Commission regards this as a most useful innovation and urges that the practice be continued.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0182.wav,Liaison With Local Law Enforcement Agencies
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0183.wav,Advice by the Secret Service to local police in metropolitan areas relating to the assistance expected in connection with a Presidential visit
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0184.wav,has hitherto been handled on an informal basis.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0185.wav,"The Service should consider preparing formal explanations of the cooperation anticipated during a Presidential visit to a city,"
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0186.wav,in formats that can be communicated to each level of local authorities.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0187.wav,"Thus, the local chief of police could be given a master plan, prepared for the occasion, of all protective measures to be taken during the visit;"
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0188.wav,each patrolman might be given a prepared booklet of instructions explaining what is expected of him. The Secret Service has expressed concern
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0189.wav,"that written instructions might come into the hands of local newspapers, to the prejudice of the precautions described."
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0190.wav,"However, the instructions must be communicated to the local police in any event and can be leaked to the press whether or not they are in writing."
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0191.wav,"More importantly, the lack of carefully prepared and carefully transmitted instructions for typical visits to cities"
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0192.wav,"can lead to lapses in protection, such as the confusion in Dallas about whether members of the public were permitted on overpasses."
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0193.wav,"Such instructions will not fit all circumstances, of course,"
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0194.wav,and should not be relied upon to the detriment of the imaginative application of judgment in special cases.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0195.wav,Inspection of Buildings
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0196.wav,"Since the assassination of President Kennedy, the Secret Service has been experimenting with new techniques in the inspection of buildings along a motorcade route."
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0197.wav,"According to Secretary Dillon,"
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0198.wav,the studies indicate that there is some utility in attempting to designate certain buildings as involving a higher risk than others.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0199.wav,The Commission strongly encourages these efforts to improve protection along a motorcade route.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0200.wav,The Secret Service should utilize the personnel of other Federal law enforcement offices
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0201.wav,"in the locality to assure adequate manpower for this task, as it is now doing."
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0202.wav,Lack of adequate resources is an unacceptable excuse for failing to improve advance precautions
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0203.wav,in this crucial area of Presidential protection.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0204.wav,Secret Service Personnel and Facilities
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0205.wav,Testimony and other evidence before the Commission
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0206.wav,suggest that the Secret Service is trying to accomplish its job with too few people and without adequate modern equipment.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0207.wav,"Although Chief Rowley does not complain about the pay scale for Secret Service agents,"
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0208.wav,salaries are below those of the FBI and leading municipal police forces.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0209.wav,The assistant to the Director of the FBI testified that
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0210.wav,"the caseload of each FBI agent averaged twenty to twenty-five, and he felt that this was high."
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0211.wav,Chief Rowley testified that the present workload of each Secret Service agent averages one hundred ten point one cases.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0212.wav,"While these statistics relate to the activities of Secret Service agents stationed in field offices and not the White House detail,"
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0213.wav,"field agents supplement those on the detail, particularly when the President is traveling."
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0214.wav,"Although the Commission does not know whether the cases involved are entirely comparable,"
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0215.wav,these figures suggest that the agents of the Secret Service are substantially overworked.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0216.wav,"In its budget request for the fiscal year beginning July one, nineteen sixty-four,"
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0217.wav,"the Secret Service sought funds for twenty-five new positions, primarily in field offices. This increase has been approved by the Congress."
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0218.wav,Chief Rowley explained that this would not provide enough additional manpower to take all the measures which he considers required.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0219.wav,"However, the nineteen sixty-four to sixty-five budget request was submitted in November nineteen sixty-three"
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0220.wav,and requests for additional personnel were not made because of the studies then being conducted.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0221.wav,The Secret Service has now presented its recommendations to the Bureau of the Budget. The plan proposed by the Service
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0222.wav,would take approximately twenty months to implement and require expenditures of approximately three million dollars during that period.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0223.wav,The plan provides for an additional two hundred five agents for the Secret Service. Seventeen of this number are proposed for the Protective Research Section;
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0224.wav,one hundred forty-five are proposed for the field offices to handle the increased volume of security investigations
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0225.wav,and be available to protect the President or Vice President when they travel;
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0226.wav,eighteen agents are proposed for a rotating pool which will go through an intensive training cycle and also be available to supplement the White House detail
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0227.wav,in case of unexpected need; and twenty-five additional agents are recommended to provide the Vice President full protection.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0228.wav,"The Commission urges that the Bureau of the Budget review these recommendations with the Secret Service and authorize a request for the necessary supplemental appropriation,"
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0229.wav,as soon as it can be justified. The Congress has often stressed that it will support any reasonable request for funds for the protection of the President.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0230.wav,Manpower and Technical Assistance From Other Agencies
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0231.wav,Before the assassination the Secret Service infrequently requested other Federal law enforcement agencies to provide personnel
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0232.wav,to assist in its protection functions.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0233.wav,"Since the assassination, the Service has experimented with the use of agents borrowed for short periods from such agencies."
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0234.wav,It has used other Treasury law enforcement agents on special experiments in building and route surveys in places to which the President frequently travels.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0235.wav,It has also used other Federal law enforcement agents during Presidential visits to cities in which such agents are stationed.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0236.wav,"Thus, in the four months following the assassination,"
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0237.wav,"the FBI, on sixteen separate occasions, supplied a total of one hundred thirty-nine agents to assist in protection work during a Presidential visit,"
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0238.wav,which represents a departure from its prior practice.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0239.wav,"From February eleven through June thirty, nineteen sixty-four,"
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0240.wav,"the Service had the advantage of nine thousand, five hundred hours of work by other enforcement agencies."
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0241.wav,"The FBI has indicated that it is willing to continue to make such assistance available,"
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0242.wav,even though it agrees with the Secret Service that it is preferable for the Service to have enough agents to handle all protective demands.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0243.wav,"The Commission endorses these efforts to supplement the Service's own personnel by obtaining, for short periods of time,"
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0244.wav,the assistance of trained Federal law enforcement officers.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0245.wav,"In view of the ever-increasing mobility of American Presidents, it seems unlikely that the Service could or should increase its own staff to a size"
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0246.wav,which would permit it to provide adequate protective manpower for all situations.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0247.wav,"The Commission recommends that the agencies involved determine how much periodic assistance they can provide, and that each such agency"
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0248.wav,and the Secret Service enter into a formal agreement defining such arrangements.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0249.wav,It may eventually be desirable to codify the practice in an Executive order.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0250.wav,The Secret Service will be better able to plan its own long-range personnel requirements if it knows with reasonable certainty
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0251.wav,the amount of assistance that it can expect from other agencies.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0252.wav,The occasional use of personnel from other Federal agencies to assist in protecting the President has a further advantage. It symbolizes the reality
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0253.wav,that the job of protecting the President has not been and cannot be exclusively the responsibility of the Secret Service.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0254.wav,The Secret Service in the past has sometimes guarded its right to be acknowledged as the sole protector of the Chief Executive.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0255.wav,This no longer appears to be the case.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0256.wav,Protecting the President is a difficult and complex task which requires full use of the best resources of many parts of our Government.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0257.wav,Recognition that the responsibility must be shared increases the likelihood that it will be met.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0258.wav,"Much of the Secret Service work requires the development and use of highly sophisticated equipment,"
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0259.wav,"some of which must be specially designed to fit unique requirements. Even before the assassination, and to a far greater extent thereafter,"
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0260.wav,the Secret Service has been receiving full cooperation in scientific research and technological development
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0261.wav,from many Government agencies including the Department of Defense and the President's Office of Science and Technology.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0262.wav,"Even if the manpower and technological resources of the Secret Service are adequately augmented,"
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0263.wav,it will continue to rely in many respects upon the greater resources of the Office of Science and Technology and other agencies.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0264.wav,The Commission recommends that the present arrangements
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0265.wav,with the Office of Science and Technology and the other Federal agencies that have been so helpful to the Secret Service be placed on a permanent and formal basis.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0266.wav,"The exchange of letters dated August thirty-one, nineteen sixty-four,"
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0267.wav,"between Secretary Dillon and Donald F. Hornig, Special Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, is a useful effort in the right direction."
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0268.wav,The Service should negotiate a memorandum of understanding with each agency that has been assisting it and from which it can expect to need help in the future.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0269.wav,The essential terms of such memoranda might well be embodied in an Executive order.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0270.wav,This Commission can recommend no procedures for the future protection of our Presidents which will guarantee security.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0271.wav,The demands on the President in the execution of His responsibilities in today's world are so varied and complex
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0272.wav,and the traditions of the office in a democracy such as ours are so deep-seated as to preclude absolute security.
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0273.wav,"The Commission has, however, from its examination of the facts of President Kennedy's assassination"
C:\Users\DYAVADI\Desktop\Project\Speech-To-Text\data\LJSpeech-1.1\wavs\LJ050-0274.wav,"made certain recommendations which it believes would, if adopted,"
